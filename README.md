This helper is intended to help keep track of what materials you have collected so far.

It's based on the 'introduction quests' that you get between level 1 and roughly level 10 (basically until you start to get away from Golden Field town) and the main story quest really opens up in the world.

Coding is not my industry, I just enjoy python and I know BASIC python - enough to make this simple tracker. I am in no way an expert or meticulous when it comes to coding so there may be bugs!!!
Its all written in python with tk, json and PIL libraries.

I am in no way affilited with Artificial Core (the game, Corepunk, developer)

This is a fan made tool and is not intended for any other use than a substitute for an excel sheet! You can always keep count in your bags as well so this program offers no benefit over other players. 
It is only a visual tool for tracking progress.


Thanks for trying it.

I am 7empestCore in the official Corepunk discord if you want to reach out for feedback/bug reporting/feature request/missing information etc x
